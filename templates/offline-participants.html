<h2>Download Participant List</h2>

<p>Click <a href="participants.xlsx">here</a> to download an Excel spreadsheet with
the current list of all participants.</p>


<h2>Upload Participant List</h2>

<p>You can edit the Excel spreadsheet offline and then upload the edited version here.
    This will modify the participants database. Please take care of the following points
    if you do this:
    <ul>
        <li>Be VERY VERY CAREFUL about not messing up the spreadsheet. Any values in the
            database will be overwritten without further sanity checks by the spreadsheet
            you upload. There is no backup. So it is absolutely possible to destroy
            information in the database if you're not careful. (You might want to make
            a backup copy of the spreadsheet you downloaded, so you can restore the
            original participants table in case something goes wrong.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Please do not change or reorder the columns in the table.
            In particular, please do not touch the header row or the "ID" column, because the upload
            script needs these to identify the different participants.
            Do feel free to modify the contents of the individual cells
            in the spreadsheet.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
