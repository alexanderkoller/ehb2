<p>Welcome, {{ prt.firstname }} {{ prt.lastname }}!</p>

<p>On this page, you can let us know whether you want a single room, who you would
    like to share your room with, and whether you are bringing guests.
    When you click "Submit" below, you will pay for these extras by Paypal,
    and these extras will be ready for you when you come to Leipzig.</p>
