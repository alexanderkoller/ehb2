Dear {{ prt.fullname() }},

I'd like to remind you personally that we have not received an Extras booking
from you, although the deadline for submitting the Extras page was last Sunday.

If we don't hear from you by tomorrow (Thursday) night, we are going to
assume that you:

- want a double/twin room from __________________, shared with any other participant
- are not bringing any guests

If any of these is not correct, please go to the following URL by TOMORROW NIGHT
and complete your booking:

http://apply.europeanharmonybrigade.org/extras.html?={{ prt.code }}

Even if you do not want any extras, it still helps us if you submit the form
with the default values, so we know that we have all the data.

Cheers,
Eileen
