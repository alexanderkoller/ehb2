Dear {{ prt.fullname() }},

thank you for submitting your extras booking for {{ conf.shortname }}!

{% if pay_now == 0 %}We confirm that you have not booked any extras.
{% else %}We confirm that you have booked the following items, and that we have
received your payment for these (total of {{ pay_now|eur }}):

{% for item, pay_to_hotel, pay_to_ehb in items %}{% if pay_to_ehb > 0 %}- {{ item }}: {{ pay_to_ehb|eur }}
{% endif %}{% endfor %}{% endif %}

We will make sure your accommodation at the hotel is booked as follows.
Please be prepared to settle this bill (for a total of {{ pay_to_hotel|eur }})
with the hotel directly when you check in.

{% for item, pay_to_hotel, pay_to_ehb in items %}{% if pay_to_ehb == 0 %}- {{ item }}: {{ pay_to_hotel|eur }}{# pay_to_hotel == 0 would skip unchanged double rooms, shared with specific participant #}
{% endif %}{% endfor %}

If you added further comments, we have received these as well and will
take them into account.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to get in touch.

Regards,
{{ conf.shortname }} Organizers.
